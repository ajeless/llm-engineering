      "|----------|----------------|----------------|\n",
      "| **Understanding** | Parse nuanced prompts, follow multi‑step instructions, keep context across long conversations (up to ~128 k tokens in the latest API). | Reduces the need for repeated clarification and enables complex workflows. |\n",
      "| **Generation** | Produce fluent, coherent, and stylistically adaptable text (technical writing, creative storytelling, code, etc.). | Saves time and can serve as a first draft for many content types. |\n",
      "| **Reasoning** | Perform chain‑of‑thought reasoning, basic arithmetic, logic puzzles, and explain concepts step‑by‑step. | Helps users verify answers and understand the underlying process. |\n",
      "| **Multimodal (where enabled)** | Interpret images and generate descriptions or answer questions about them. | Extends usefulness to visual data without needing separate models. |\n",
      "| **Safety & Alignment** | Detect many disallowed content requests, provide warnings, and refuse when appropriate. | Helps maintain ethical use and reduces risk of harmful output. |\n",
      "| **Tool Use (via API integrations)** | Call external functions, retrieve up‑to‑date information, or execute code when paired with plugins or the “function calling” feature. | Overcomes the static knowledge cutoff and enables real‑time data access. |\n",
      "| **Speed & Cost** | Optimized for low latency and lower token pricing compared to earlier GPT‑4 variants. | Practical for both casual users and high‑volume developers. |\n",

      "| **Knowledge cutoff** | My training data stops at September 2023; I don’t know events, research, or releases after that unless provided via plugins or user input. | May give outdated answers on very recent topics. |\n",
      "| **Hallucination** | Occasionally generate plausible‑sounding but inaccurate facts, especially for niche or obscure details. | Users must verify critical information (e.g., medical, legal, financial advice). |\n",
      "| **Depth of specialist expertise** | I can discuss many domains at a competent level, but I’m not a substitute for a domain‑specific expert system or peer‑reviewed source. | For highly technical or regulated work, human review is essential. |\n",
      "| **Long‑term memory** | Each conversation is stateless beyond the token window; I can’t retain information across sessions unless the developer implements external memory. | Not ideal for personal assistants that need persistent personal history without extra infrastructure. |\n",
      "| **Interpretation of ambiguous prompts** | If a request is vague, I may guess the intended meaning, which can lead to off‑target output. | Clear, well‑structured prompts yield the best results. |\n",

      "| **General‑purpose conversation & assistance** | Its balance of fluency, reasoning, and safety makes it a strong default for chat‑based applications. |\n",
      "| **Large context windows** | When you need to process long documents, transcripts, or multi‑turn dialogues, the extended token limit reduces the need for chunking. |\n",
      "| **Cost‑sensitive high‑throughput use** | Compared with the base GPT‑4 model, Turbo offers lower per‑token pricing while retaining most of the same capabilities. |\n",
      "| **Multimodal needs (image + text)** | If your product must understand images as well as text, the multimodal variant of GPT‑4 Turbo provides a single, unified API. |\n",
      "| **Safety‑critical deployments** | The model benefits from OpenAI’s latest alignment research, making it a safer choice for public‑facing or regulated environments. |\n",
      "| **Integration with OpenAI’s ecosystem** | When you want to combine language generation with tools like function calling, retrieval‑augmented generation, or the DALL·E image generator, staying within the OpenAI platform simplifies development. |\n",
      "| **Rapid prototyping** | Its fast inference speed allows developers to iterate quickly on prompts and UI designs without paying for slower, larger models. |\n",

      "**When you might pick another model instead**\n",
      "\n",
      "| Alternative | Reason to prefer it |\n",
      "|-------------|----------------------|\n",
      "| **Smaller open‑source models (e.g., Llama‑3‑8B, Mistral‑7B)** | Lower inference cost on‑premises, full control over weights, or compliance requirements that prohibit third‑party cloud APIs. |\n",
      "| **Specialized domain models (e.g., Codex for programming, BioGPT for biomedical text)** | When a model is trained specifically on a narrow corpus, it can outperform a generalist in that niche. |\n",
      "| **Very low‑latency edge deployments** | If you need inference on-device with milliseconds of latency, ultra‑compact models are a better fit. |\n",
